# CSC8004-Web-Technologies
The practical assessment for CSC8004 (Web Technologies). The project consisted of two parts. The first was to use valid CSS 2.1 to present a provided HTML document as it was shown in a provided resource image, as well as reformatting the provided HTML document into valid XHTML 1.0 Strict. The second part was to make a quiz about flags in Javascript, using a basic HTML form as a reference. The aim of the assignment was to introduce me to some of the practical skills required to create functional, standards-compliant web pages using XHTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Part 1: Using CSS
Instructions
Add valid CSS to flags-XHTML.html in order to present the document as shown in the resource
file:
flags-CSS.png
Save your finished document and submit it to NESS as:
flags-CSS.html
All your CSS must be contained inside a single external file, linked to flags-CSS.html and
called:
flags-CSS.css
Comments should be included in your style sheet to explain the basic functionality of each rule
and (if you found inspiration elsewhere) the source of your CSS code.

Part 2: Client-side Scripting
Instructions
This part uses the following file from the resource area for these tasks:
flag-QUIZ.html
This is a basic XHTML form which presents a short quiz about flags. View this file in a text editor
and note that it links to a single external JavaScript source file called:
validate-QUIZ.js
At the moment that file doesn't exist – your primary task is to create it, according to the criteria
given below.
You will not be able to edit flag-QUIZ.html in any way – all you will be submitting is your new
JavaScript source file.
Also notice that flag-QUIZ.html also links to a CSS style sheet called:
flag-QUIZ.css
This is a CSS style sheet that you can create as a secondary objective for this assignment. See
the specification for details.
